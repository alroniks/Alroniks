# Hi, I'm [Ivan Klimchuk](https://klimchuk.com/) üëãüèº.

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** and **Department Lead** (actually do role of Engineering Manager) based in Minsk, Belarus, working at [OnePoint](https://1pt.com/) formally, but actually I improve [TAO Project](https://www.taotesting.com/) last five years. The project is about providing tools for e-assessments according to modern and common standards.

I'm a coding passion focused on PHP and Go, interested in design, tech, smart homes, and of course open-source activities.

## Open Source

I love open source and try to participate in it regularly. I am a lucky guy because my working project actually is open-sourced which allows me to work and enjoy at the same time. Reach out if you also want to join our team.

Besides TAO, more than 10 years of my life I spent and continue spending to support MODX, a framework, and a content management system. I started as a simple user and now I am one of the maintainers. Behind shoulders [participation in meetups and conferences](https://klimchuk.com/talks/), including the organization of the largest MODX conference ‚Äì **MODXpo 2017** ‚Äì in Minsk.

Also, I provide consulting service about software development and building software solutions.

## Pet Projects

From time to time I share my pet projects with the big world, which means I proud to show them. Here a list of such projects.

### [pravilna.by](https://pravilna.by/)
It is a set of rules of the Belarusian language, which actually published in many places already, but I collected them in the more conventional view with links to the specific paragraphs and points, with searching by rules, etc. Based on analytics I see that students at schools actively use my service, which means it is useful to the people. The best metric of my work.

Full list of my projects [listed on the website](https://klimchuk.com/projects/).

## Other

Aside from coding, I enjoy writing thoughts and notes from travel on my blog [in Russian](https://klimchuk.by/notes/) and [English](https://klimchuk.com/notes/).
