# Hi, I'm Ivan Klimchuk üëãüèº.

I am a **Senior Fullstack Software Engineer** at [Galactica Games]([https://1pt.com/](https://galactica.games/)). I joined the project in 2023 and since that time we have been focused on building the best payment infrastructure for real money mobile games. My current tech stack is various and includes TypeScript, NodeJS, React Native, C#, Unity, Objective-C, NextJS, NestJS, and maybe Rust in the future.

In the past, I've been working as a Senior Software Engineer, SRE, and Engineering Manager on improving [TAO Project](https://www.taotesting.com/) for about eight years. The project is about providing tools for e-assessments according to modern and common standards. I have a coding passion with PHP, Golang, and sometimes JavaScript. 

I am interested in design, tech, smart homes, and open-source activities.

## Open Source

I love open source and try to participate in it regularly.

Besides TAO, for more than ten years of my life, I spent and continue spending to support MODX. It is a framework and a content management system. I started as a simple user, and now I am one of the maintainers. In the past, there has been participation in meetups and conferences, including being an organizer of the largest MODX conference ‚Äì **MODXpo 2017** ‚Äì in Minsk.

I appreciate any support for my open-source activity. If you would like to support me, please, subscribe on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ivanklimchuk) page or use any membership on the [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ivanklimchuk/membership). There are also possible one-time gratitudes. Additionally, I provide consulting services for software development and building software solutions. Based not only on MODX.

## Pet Projects

Unregularly, but I share my pet projects with the big world, which means I am proud to show them. Here is a list of such.

### [pravilna.by](https://pravilna.by/)
It is a set of rules of the Belarusian language. Rules themselves exist in many places, including textbooks. I have collected them in a more convenient view with links to the specific paragraphs and points, including search by rules, etc. Based on analytics, I see that students and pupils actively use my service. It means they find it convenient. It is the best metric of my work.

## Indie Maker & Solopreneur

In the middle of November, I decided to become an indie-maker. I like how people build and grow their projects, sell them, and make them ramen profitable. In some cases, they achieve outstanding results. I wrote a note about my decision to become an indie maker on Medium ‚Äî [Indie-making Journey Begun](https://medium.com/@ivanklimchuk/indie-making-journey-begun-d62cb0532d6f). Feel free to [follow me](https://medium.com/@ivanklimchuk) there. I am writing regularly.

As well I write my newsletter ‚Äî [Ivan's Weekly Focus](https://ivanklimchuk.substack.com/). In the issues, I share my progress in indie making journey. Subscribe to get tips about productivity. Because I do it having 9-to-5 work as Software Developer and Manager, one toddler, and one newborn, and loving to sleep longer. So, for me, it is a bit tricky, but I manage. [Subscribe](https://ivanklimchuk.substack.com/) for inspiration as well.
